- 🔧 **Development tools** with [Ruff](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/) for linting and formatting
- 🛡️ **Security** with pre-commit hooks and secret detection
- 🧪 **Testing** with pytest and coverage reporting
- 📦 **Easy installation** with pipx support
- 🎯 **Type safety** with mypy
- 📋 **Code quality** with comprehensive linting rules
- 🚀 **CI/CD** with GitHub Actions for testing, linting, and releases
- 📊 **Coverage reporting** with Codecov integration

## 🛡️ Security Tools

This template includes comprehensive security scanning tools that run automatically in CI/CD pipelines and can be used during development:

- **[Trivy](https://trivy.dev/)** - Vulnerability scanner for filesystems, containers, and packages
  - Scans for known vulnerabilities in dependencies
  - Generates detailed security reports in multiple formats
  - Integrated into CI pipeline and release artifacts

- **[Bandit](https://bandit.readthedocs.io/)** - Security linter for Python code
  - Identifies common security issues in Python code
  - Configurable via `pyproject.toml`
  - Runs automatically in CI pipeline

- **[Safety](https://pyup.io/safety/)** - Dependency vulnerability scanner
  - Checks Python dependencies against known security vulnerabilities
  - Integrates with requirements and package files
  - Provides detailed vulnerability reports

- **[detect-secrets](https://github.com/Yelp/detect-secrets)** - Prevents secrets from being committed
  - Scans for API keys, tokens, and other sensitive data
  - Uses baseline file to track known false positives
  - Runs as pre-commit hook and in CI pipeline

All security tools generate JSON reports that are included as artifacts in GitHub releases, providing transparency and audit trails for security compliance.

## 🚀 Quick Start with pipx

[pipx](https://pypa.github.io/pipx/) is the recommended way to install Python CLI applications. It installs packages in isolated environments while making their entry points available globally.

### Install pipx (if not already installed)

```bash
# On macOS
brew install pipx

# On Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt update && sudo apt install pipx

# On other systems with pip
python3 -m pip install --user pipx
python3 -m pipx ensurepath
```

### Install the CLI

```bash
# Install from PyPI (when published)
pipx install py-plate-template

# Or install from local directory
pipx install .

# Or install in development mode
pipx install --editable .
```

### Usage

```bash
# Show help
py-plate --help

# Greet someone
py-plate hello Alice

# Greet with options
py-plate hello Bob --count 3 --shout

# Show system information
py-plate info

# Show version
py-plate --version

# Manage configuration
py-plate config --show
py-plate config --set debug true
```

## 🛠️ Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.9 or higher
- pip or pipx

### Development Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/GRodolphe/py_plate.git
cd py_plate

# Install in development mode with all dependencies
pip install -e ".[dev]"

# Or use pipx for isolated development
pipx install --editable ".[dev]"
```

### Set up pre-commit hooks

```bash
# Install pre-commit hooks
pre-commit install

# Run hooks on all files (optional)
pre-commit run --all-files
```

## 🧪 Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
pytest

# Run with coverage
pytest --cov

# Run specific test file
pytest tests/test_cli.py

# Run with verbose output
pytest -v
```

## 🔧 Development Commands

```bash
# Format code
ruff format

# Lint code
ruff check

# Fix linting issues automatically
ruff check --fix

# Type check
mypy src/

# Run all quality checks
ruff check && ruff format --check && mypy src/ && pytest
```

## 📦 Building and Publishing

```bash
# Build the package
python -m build

# Upload to PyPI (requires authentication)
python -m twine upload dist/*
```
